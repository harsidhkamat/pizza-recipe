# The method: # 

### STEP 1 ###

##### Make the base: #####

 Put the **flour** into a **large** bowl, then stir in the **yeast** and **salt**. Make a well, pour in *200* ml **warm** water and the **olive oil** and bring together with a **wooden spoon** until you have a *soft*, fairly *wet* dough. Turn onto a **lightly** floured surface and knead for *5* mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to *rise* if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.

### STEP 2 ###

##### Make the sauce: #####

 Mix the **passata**, __basil__ and _crushed_ garlic together, then __season__ to taste. Leave to stand at _room_ temperature while you get on with _shaping_ the base.

### STEP 3 ###

##### Roll out the dough: #####

 If you’ve let the dough _rise_, give it a quick knead, then split into _two_ balls. On a __floured__ surface, _roll_ out the dough into _large_ rounds, about _25_ cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very __thin__ as it will _rise_ in the __oven__. Lift the rounds onto _two_ __floured__ baking sheets.

### STEP 4 ###

##### Top and bake: #####

 Heat the oven to _240C/220C_ _fan/gas 8_. Put another __baking sheet__ or an __upturned baking tray__ in the __oven__ on the top shelf. _Smooth_ sauce over bases with the _back_ of a __spoon__. Scatter with __cheese__ and __tomatoes__, drizzle with __olive oil__ and __season__. Put _one_ __pizza__, still on its __baking sheet__, on top of the _preheated_ sheet or tray. Bake for _8-10_ mins until __crisp__. Serve with a little more __olive oil__, and __basil leaves__ if using. Repeat step for remaining __pizza__.
